# Cruciatus.Xml
A small tool to help testing with the Winium.Cruciatus and Winium.Desktop driver.

## What is it
This far it comes as a command line tool.

## What does it do
It can do two things for you, using the Cruciatus library it can get you the exact xml structure generated by the 
library and used in Winum.Desktop. Imagine you want to identify something by xpath, well, instead of having to run a 
script over and over again until you get it right, you can get the xml and try it out.

It also allows you to test xpaths directly on an application, returning the properties of the element matched.

## Arguments
```
-p, --process    process id to get xml for.
-d, --debug      launches the windows debugger on program start.
-t, --test       xpath to test for finding an element in the application.
--help           Display this help screen.
```

## Usage
Select any element where name matches 'Save'
```
Cruciatus.Xml.CLI.exe -p 21322 -t \\*[@Name='Save']
```

Get the application xml
```
Cruciatus.XML.CLI.exe -p 21322 > Output.xml
```
